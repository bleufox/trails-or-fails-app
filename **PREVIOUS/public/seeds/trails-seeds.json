        "description": "Tamanawas is an impressive 150' waterfall with easy access from Rt. 35. It's a shady hike through Douglas Firs and Cedars with a dry cave to explore behind the falls. This easy trail in the Mt Hood National Forest has a journey just as lovely as the destination. The hike follows closely along the banks of Cold Spring Creek, up through a massive boulder field, and finally arrives at the 150ft tall Tamanawas."

        "description": "A short drive from downtown Portland, Latourell Falls Loop Trail is a moderately difficult trek through Guy W. Talbot State Park to Upper Latourell Falls. This is a very popular trail to the third tallest waterfall in the Columbia Gorge. The upper falls and part of the trail are part of George W. Joseph State Natural Area, named for the family that gave the land to the state in 1934 and 1942. The trail starts at the Latourell Falls Trailhead just off the Historic Columbia River Highway. The majority of the trailâ€™s elevation is at the beginning of the hike and certain areas can get slightly muddy and slippery so proper footwear is required. The town of Latourell borders the north side of the park. Please respect the privacy of nearby residents."

The parking area at the trailhead is very well maintained, and is located just a short distance from I-84. Since this trailhead is very popular throughout the year, parking can be difficult past 10:00 A.M., but there is additional parking on the road located a few hundred feet west of the trailhead."
